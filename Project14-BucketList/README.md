# Project 14 - BucketList

https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/68

## Topics

MapKit, Biometric authentication, Secure data writing, Comparable custom types, Documents directory

## Challenges

From [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/bucket-list-wrap-up):

>1. Our + button is rather hard to tap. Try moving all its modifiers to the image inside the button – what difference does it make, and can you think why?
>2. Having a complex if condition in the middle of ContentView isn’t easy to read – can you rewrite it so that the MapView, Circle, and Button are part of their own view? This might take more work than you think!
>3. Our app silently fails when errors occur during biometric authentication. Add code to show those errors in an alert, but be careful: you can only add one alert() modifier to each view.
